# bash_yt_mp3_downloader
A simple bash script that uses youtube-dl to download mp3 from youtube.

# How to use:
  Install youtube-dl from: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#readme
  
  Write in your terminal chmod +x dw.sh in order to give it the right privilages 
  
  Execute as ./dw.sh '<youtube_link>' (notice that you should put the link between ')

# Troubleshooting:
  Make sure you pasted the URL between ' or "   
  Some terminals convert the /watch?v to /watch\?v\ when pasting. Make sure that you remove the \ if it is the case
